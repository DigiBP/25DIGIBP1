# SVK Feedback Classification Guide

This document outlines the classification criteria for feedback. It defines how to categorize feedback.

## 1. Feedback Type

Feedback should be classified into one of the following categories:

- **Positive**  
  Praise or recognition for SVK’s services or collaboration.

- **Negative**  
  Criticism or complaints about delays, communication issues, or dissatisfaction with SVK’s services.

- **Suggestion**  
  Proposals to improve SVK’s processes, services, or communication.

## 2. Impact Scope

Determine the breadth of stakeholders affected by the feedback:

- **Stakeholder-Specific**  
  Affects 1–2 individual stakeholders (e.g., a single user or client).

- **Small Stakeholder Group**  
  Affects one department or a small functional team.

- **Large Stakeholder Group**  
  Potentially affects multiple departments or all of SVK.

## 3. Urgency

Assign an urgency level to the feedback to guide prioritization:

- **Low**  
  Does not require immediate attention and can be integrated into regular workflows.

- **Medium**  
  Should be addressed promptly to avoid potential dissatisfaction or escalation.

- **High**  
  Requires immediate action due to critical impacts on collaboration or SVK’s reputation.

## 4. Can You Implement the Action Immediately?

Assess whether the required action can be carried out without delay:

- **Yes**  
  The action can be implemented immediately, without needing additional resources or approvals.

- **No**  
  Implementation requires additional resources, coordination, or approvals and cannot be done immediately.

## 5. Are You the Right Employee to Take Action?

Confirm whether you have the competence and authority to handle the feedback:

- **Yes**  
  You have the professional competence and authority to respond directly and take the necessary actions.

- **No**  
  The feedback falls outside your area of expertise or authority and should be forwarded to the responsible department or individual.
