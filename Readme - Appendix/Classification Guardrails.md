# SVK Feedback Classification Guide

This document outlines the classification criteria for feedback received by SVK. It defines how to categorize feedback based on type, impact scope, urgency, implementability, and appropriate ownership. Use these guidelines to ensure consistent handling and timely resolution of feedback.

---

## 1. Feedback Type

Feedback should be classified into one of the following categories:

- **Positive**  
  Praise or recognition for SVK’s services or collaboration.

- **Negative**  
  Criticism or complaints about delays, communication issues, or dissatisfaction with SVK’s services.

- **Suggestion**  
  Proposals to improve SVK’s processes, services, or communication.

---

## 2. Impact Scope

Determine the breadth of stakeholders affected by the feedback:

- **Stakeholder-Specific**  
  Affects 1–2 individual stakeholders (e.g., a single user or client).

- **Small Stakeholder Group**  
  Affects one department or a small functional team.

- **Large Stakeholder Group**  
  Potentially affects multiple departments or all of SVK.

---

## 3. Urgency

Assign an urgency level to the feedback to guide prioritization:

- **Low**  
  Does not require immediate attention and can be integrated into regular workflows.

- **Medium**  
  Should be addressed promptly to avoid potential dissatisfaction or escalation.

- **High**  
  Requires immediate action due to critical impacts on collaboration or SVK’s reputation.

---

## 4. Can You Implement the Action Immediately?

Assess whether the required action can be carried out without delay:

- **Yes**  
  The action can be implemented immediately, without needing additional resources or approvals.

- **No**  
  Implementation requires additional resources, coordination, or approvals and cannot be done immediately.

---

## 5. Are You the Right Employee to Take Action?

Confirm whether you have the competence and authority to handle the feedback:

- **Yes**  
  You have the professional competence and authority to respond directly and take the necessary actions.

- **No**  
  The feedback falls outside your area of expertise or authority and should be forwarded to the responsible department or individual.

## Usage Workflow

1. **Receive Feedback**  
   - Log the feedback into the tracking system.

2. **Classify by Feedback Type**  
   - Determine whether it is positive, negative, or a suggestion.

3. **Assess Impact Scope**  
   - Identify how many stakeholders or departments are affected.

4. **Assign Urgency Level**  
   - Decide if the issue is Low, Medium, or High priority.

5. **Check Implementability**  
   - Can the action be taken immediately, or does it require further resources?

6. **Confirm Ownership**  
   - Verify if you are the right employee to handle this feedback.  
   - If **Yes**, proceed with action or response.  
   - If **No**, forward to the appropriate team or manager.

7. **Document and Track**  
   - Record all steps taken, including any handoffs or escalations.
   - Update the feedback status as it moves through the resolution process.

> 2. **Impact Scope:** Small Stakeholder Group (affected department)  
> 3. **Urgency:** High (delays are blocking planning)
