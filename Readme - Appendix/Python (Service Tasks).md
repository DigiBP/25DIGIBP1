# Worker Scripts Overview

This document provides an overview of the Python worker scripts used in the feedback management process. Each worker is an independent service that implements the External Task pattern with Camunda BPM. These workers subscribe to specific BPMN service task topics and handle operations such as sending emails, updating an Excel-based database, or interacting with JotForm.

Each script is responsible for one clearly defined task, making the system modular and maintainable. If a script fails, Camunda retries the task automatically. Shared logic and configuration (e.g. email settings, file paths) are encapsulated in a common helper module.

## Execution

All workers are launched concurrently using `subprocess.Popen()` in the `launch_all_workers.py` script. They remain active and poll Camunda for new tasks via the REST API.

## Structure

See the table below for a mapping of worker scripts to their BPMN service tasks and responsibilities:


| **Script Name**                         | **BPMN Service Task**                               | **Purpose** |

# Configuration Guide

To run the feedback processing system, you must first ensure the correct setup of the configuration files and external resources.

## üîê Secrets: Required Local Files

Two files **must be created manually** in your local repository (they are intentionally excluded from version control):

- `api_key.txt` ‚Äî contains the API key for accessing the JotForm API.
- `password.txt` ‚Äî contains the password for the email account used to send notifications.

üìÅ **Recommended location:** place both files in the `python` folder (i.e., the same directory as the worker scripts). If placed there, no changes to the config file are necessary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è `config.json` Overview

This file defines all runtime settings for the workers and the web application. Below are the key fields and what you might need to adapt:

| **Key**                 | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `camundaEngineUrl`      | The REST API endpoint of the Camunda engine. Adapt if you're running your own Camunda instance. |
| `excelFilePath`         | Path to the feedback database (Excel). This file is automatically generated on first feedback entry. No need to create it manually. |
| `passwordFilePath`      | Path to the `password.txt` file (see above). |
| `apiKeyPath`            | Path to the `api_key.txt` file (see above). |
| `tenantID`              | Your Camunda tenant ID. Usually fixed per deployment. |
| `documentationFormID`  | JotForm form ID used for internal documentation (departments). |
| `supplementationFormID`| JotForm form ID used for clarification requests to submitters. |
| `emailHost`             | SMTP server for sending emails (e.g., Infomaniak). |
| `emailUser`             | Sender email address used by all workers. |
| `emailPort`             | SMTP port (465 for SSL). |
| `webappHostIP`          | Host IP for the local Flask web interface (usually 127.0.0.1). |
| `webappPort`            | Port for the Flask web interface (default: 5000). |
| `ceoName`               | Name used in emails when notifying leadership. |
| `ceoEmail`              | Recipient address for urgent feedback notifications. |
| `departments`           | List of departments that can receive feedback, each with a name and email. You can add or remove departments here. |

## ‚úÖ Example

If your repository has this structure:
your-repo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api_key.txt
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ password.txt
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

Then the following entries will work without modification:

```json
"apiKeyPath": "api_key.txt",
"passwordFilePath": "password.txt"
```
