# Feedback Handling Scenarios

Different Handling Scenarios for different types of feedback have been defined.

- **Scenario 1**: Low-urgency suggestions or negative feedback that the feedback master can not resolve directly are added to the Review Board backlog for periodic review.

- **Scenario 2**: High-impact or urgent feedback/suggestions is forwarded to the appropriate department. The Feedback Master identifies and assigns the responsible team during classification.

- **Scenario 3**: Feedback or Suggestions that the Feedback Master can/must resolve directly are implemented immediately. 

- **Scenario 4**: Positive feedback (e.g., praise or kudos) is stored in the Review Board backlog for potential sharing and celebration during regular review meetings.
