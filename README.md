# Feedback Management Process

## Overview
This project aims to implement a standardized customer feedback management process for the **Schweizerische Verband f√ºr Gemeinschaftsaufgaben der Krankenversicherer (SVK)** in compliance with **ISO 9001:2015** (clauses 9.1.2 and 9.1.3). The goal is to systematically collect, track, and analyze customer feedback to ensure continuous improvement and regulatory compliance.

## Motivation
During an **ISO 9001:2015 audit in 2018**, SVK received feedback highlighting deficiencies in its customer feedback management system. A PDF form was introduced to collect feedback, but due to unclear processes and additional workload, its adoption remained minimal. To address this, SVK is implementing a structured **business process management (BPM) workflow** to ensure consistent feedback handling before the next audit in **August 2025**.

## Solution
This project will implement Camunda 7 to support the end-to-end management of customer feedback. The system will enable systematic feedback collection, standardized tracking and processing, automated follow-ups, and reporting. The goal is to ensure compliance with **ISO 9001:2015** while improving efficiency and usability.

## Technologies
Camunda 7 and BPMN 2.0 will be used for workflow automation and process modeling. JotForm will serve as the external tool for feedback collection.
